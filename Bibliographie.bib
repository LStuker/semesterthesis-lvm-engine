	Abstract = {This paper examines the match between chief information officer (CIO) characteristics and the organization's business strategy and how this match will influence the impact of IS on the organization's business performance. Based on the study of typologies of business strategy, alignment between IS and business strategy and upper echelon theory, a conceptual model is proposed. Survey data from 81 CIOs/IS managers is collected to empirically test the model. The results indicate that a match between business strategy and CIOs of certain repertoires of competencies, experiences and personalities could lead to better organizational performance. Specifically, the impact of IS on business performance in aligned organizations is significantly better than it is in misaligned ones.},
	Annote = {In a diverse, ever-changing marketplace,organizations are constantly seeking to harness technology to improve their core competency and gain competitive advantage. Explicitly, knowing how to apply Information Systems (IS) in an appropriate and timely way and in harmony with business strategies, goals, and needs could bring the organization to steps closer to business success. In other words, aligning IS strategy to business strategy becomes a critical issue in most organizations.
Indeed, there is an increasing amount of research and understanding on the linkages between business and IS strategies, the role of partnerships between IS and business management, and the need to understand the transformation of business strategies resulting from the competitive use of IS.},
